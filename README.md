# Repository for cloud computing project 1

Model deployment inspired with [this](https://medium.com/p/ee9d433d8787) article.

Authors of the project: Maciej Chylak, Bartosz Jamro≈ºy, Agata Kaczmarek.

The app created for the project aims at showing the key information from a text given by the user. The app allows users to write a sentence in polish, which then is forwarded to the Natural Language Processing (NLP) model. The model processes the input and returns identified entities of the text, which are then viewed to the user in the app.
